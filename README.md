# odin-recipes
This project taught me to combine html elements to make a small, linked set of webpages. It brought together learning from previous lessons on basic html code and best practice. It also was a practical lesson in git work flow and committ comments.
An added bonus was that it taugh me a new Ital Stew recipe, which I can't wait to try out!
